# Alerting

### Slack

Flagger can be configured to send Slack notifications:

```bash
helm upgrade -i flagger flagger/flagger \
--set slack.url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK \
--set slack.channel=general \
--set slack.user=flagger
```

Once configured with a Slack incoming **webhook**, Flagger will post messages when a canary deployment 
has been initialised, when a new revision has been detected and if the canary analysis failed or succeeded.

A canary deployment will be rolled back if the progress deadline exceeded or if the analysis reached the 
maximum number of failed checks:

### Microsoft Teams

Flagger can be configured to send notifications to Microsoft Teams:

```bash
helm upgrade -i flagger flagger/flagger \
--set msteams.url=https://outlook.office.com/webhook/YOUR/TEAMS/WEBHOOK
```

Flagger will post a message card to MS Teams when a new revision has been detected and if the canary analysis failed or succeeded:

And you'll get a notification on rollback:

### Prometheus Alert Manager

Besides Slack, you can use Alertmanager to trigger alerts when a canary deployment failed:

```yaml
  - alert: canary_rollback
    expr: flagger_canary_status > 1
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Canary failed"
      description: "Workload {{ $labels.name }} namespace {{ $labels.namespace }}"
```
