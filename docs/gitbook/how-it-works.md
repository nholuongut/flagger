# How it works

[Flagger](https://github.com/nholuongut/flagger) takes a Kubernetes deployment and optionally 
a horizontal pod autoscaler \(HPA\) and creates a series of objects 
\(Kubernetes deployments, ClusterIP services, virtual service, traffic split or ingress\) to drive the canary analysis and promotion. 

![Flagger Canary Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nholuongut/flagger/master/docs/diagrams/flagger-canary-hpa.png)

### Canary Custom Resource

For a deployment named _podinfo_, a canary promotion can be defined using Flagger's custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1alpha3
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: test
spec:
  # service mesh provider (optional)
  # can be: kubernetes, istio, linkerd, appmesh, nginx, gloo, supergloo
  # use the kubernetes provider for Blue/Green style deployments
  provider: istio
  # deployment reference
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: podinfo
  # the maximum time in seconds for the canary deployment
  # to make progress before it is rollback (default 600s)
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 60
  # HPA reference (optional)
  autoscalerRef:
    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
    name: podinfo
  service:
    # container port
    port: 9898
    # service port name (optional, will default to "http")
    portName: http-podinfo
    # Istio gateways (optional)
    gateways:
    - public-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
    # Istio virtual service host names (optional)
    hosts:
    - podinfo.example.com
  # promote the canary without analysing it (default false)
  skipAnalysis: false
  # define the canary analysis timing and KPIs
  canaryAnalysis:
    # schedule interval (default 60s)
    interval: 1m
    # max number of failed metric checks before rollback
    threshold: 10
    # max traffic percentage routed to canary
    # percentage (0-100)
    maxWeight: 50
    # canary increment step
    # percentage (0-100)
    stepWeight: 5
    # Prometheus checks
    metrics:
    - name: request-success-rate
      # minimum req success rate (non 5xx responses)
      # percentage (0-100)
      threshold: 99
      interval: 1m
    - name: request-duration
      # maximum req duration P99
      # milliseconds
      threshold: 500
      interval: 30s
    # external checks (optional)
    webhooks:
      - name: integration-tests
        url: http://podinfo.test:9898/echo
        timeout: 1m
        # key-value pairs (optional)
        metadata:
          test: "all"
          token: "16688eb5e9f289f1991c"
```

**Note** that the target deployment must have a single label selector in the format `app: <DEPLOYMENT-NAME>`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: podinfo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: podinfo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: podinfo
```

Besides `app` Flagger supports `name` and `app.kubernetes.io/name` selectors. If you use a different 
convention you can specify your label with the `-selector-labels` flag.

The target deployment should expose a TCP port that will be used by Flagger to create the ClusterIP Service and 
the Istio Virtual Service. The container port from the target deployment should match the `service.port` value.

### Canary status

Get the current status of canary deployments cluster wide: 

```bash
kubectl get canaries --all-namespaces

NAMESPACE   NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
test        podinfo   Progressing   15       2019-06-30T14:05:07Z
prod        frontend  Succeeded     0        2019-06-30T16:15:07Z
prod        backend   Failed        0        2019-06-30T17:05:07Z
```

The status condition reflects the last know state of the canary analysis:

```bash
kubectl -n test get canary/podinfo -oyaml | awk '/status/,0'
```

A successful rollout status:

```yaml
status:
  canaryWeight: 0
  failedChecks: 0
  iterations: 0
  lastAppliedSpec: "14788816656920327485"
  lastPromotedSpec: "14788816656920327485"
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2019-07-10T08:23:18Z"
    lastUpdateTime: "2019-07-10T08:23:18Z"
    message: Canary analysis completed successfully, promotion finished.
    reason: Succeeded
    status: "True"
    type: Promoted
```

The `Promoted` status condition can have one of the following reasons:
Initialized, Waiting, Progressing, Finalising, Succeeded or Failed.
A failed canary will have the promoted status set to `false`,
the reason to `failed` and the last applied spec will be different to the last promoted one.

Wait for a successful rollout:

```bash
kubectl wait canary/podinfo --for=condition=promoted
```

### Istio routing

Flagger creates an Istio Virtual Service and Destination Rules based on the Canary service spec. 
The service configuration lets you expose an app inside or outside the mesh.
You can also define traffic policies, HTTP match conditions, URI rewrite rules, CORS policies, timeout and retries.

The following spec exposes the `frontend` workload inside the mesh on `frontend.test.svc.cluster.local:9898` 
and outside the mesh on `frontend.example.com`. You'll have to specify an Istio ingress gateway for external hosts.

```yaml
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1alpha3
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: test
spec:
  service:
    # container port
    port: 9898
    # service port name (optional, will default to "http")
    portName: http-frontend
    # Istio gateways (optional)
    gateways:
    - public-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
    - mesh
    # Istio virtual service host names (optional)
    hosts:
    - frontend.example.com
    # Istio traffic policy (optional)
    trafficPolicy:
      loadBalancer:
        simple: LEAST_CONN
    # HTTP match conditions (optional)
    match:
      - uri:
          prefix: /
    # HTTP rewrite (optional)
    rewrite:
      uri: /
    # Envoy timeout and retry policy (optional)
    headers:
      request:
        add:
          x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms: "15000"
          x-envoy-max-retries: "10"
          x-envoy-retry-on: "gateway-error,connect-failure,refused-stream"
    # cross-origin resource sharing policy (optional)
    corsPolicy:
      allowOrigin:
        - example.com
      allowMethods:
        - GET
      allowCredentials: false
      allowHeaders:
        - x-some-header
      maxAge: 24h
```

For the above spec Flagger will generate the following virtual service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: test
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: flagger.app/v1alpha3
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
      controller: true
      kind: Canary
      name: podinfo
      uid: 3a4a40dd-3875-11e9-8e1d-42010a9c0fd1
spec:
  gateways:
    - public-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
    - mesh
  hosts:
    - frontend.example.com
    - frontend
  http:
  - appendHeaders:
      x-envoy-max-retries: "10"
      x-envoy-retry-on: gateway-error,connect-failure,refused-stream
      x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms: "15000"
    corsPolicy:
      allowHeaders:
      - x-some-header
      allowMethods:
      - GET
      allowOrigin:
      - example.com
      maxAge: 24h
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /
    rewrite:
      uri: /
    route:
    - destination:
        host: podinfo-primary
      weight: 100
    - destination:
        host: podinfo-canary
      weight: 0
```

For each destination in the virtual service a rule is generated:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: frontend-primary
  namespace: test
spec:
  host: frontend-primary
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: LEAST_CONN
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: frontend-canary
  namespace: test
spec:
  host: frontend-canary
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: LEAST_CONN
```

Flagger keeps in sync the virtual service and destination rules with the canary service spec.
Any direct modification to the virtual service spec will be overwritten.

To expose a workload inside the mesh on `http://backend.test.svc.cluster.local:9898`,
the service spec can contain only the container port:

```yaml
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1alpha3
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: backend
  namespace: test
spec:
  service:
    port: 9898
```

Based on the above spec, Flagger will create several ClusterIP services like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-primary
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: flagger.app/v1alpha3
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: Canary
    name: backend
    uid: 2ca1a9c7-2ef6-11e9-bd01-42010a9c0145
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 9898
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9898
  selector:
    app: backend-primary
```

Flagger works for user facing apps exposed outside the cluster via an ingress gateway
and for backend HTTP APIs that are accessible only from inside the mesh.

### Canary Stages

![Flagger Canary Stages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nholuongut/flagger/master/docs/diagrams/flagger-canary-steps.png)

A canary deployment is triggered by changes in any of the following objects:

* Deployment PodSpec (container image, command, ports, env, resources, etc)
* ConfigMaps mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables
* Secrets mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables

Gated canary promotion stages:

* scan for canary deployments
* check Istio virtual service routes are mapped to primary and canary ClusterIP services
* check primary and canary deployments status
    * halt advancement if a rolling update is underway
    * halt advancement if pods are unhealthy
* call pre-rollout webhooks are check results
    * halt advancement if any hook returned a non HTTP 2xx result
    * increment the failed checks counter
* increase canary traffic weight percentage from 0% to 5% (step weight)
* call rollout webhooks and check results
* check canary HTTP request success rate and latency
    * halt advancement if any metric is under the specified threshold
    * increment the failed checks counter
* check if the number of failed checks reached the threshold
    * route all traffic to primary
    * scale to zero the canary deployment and mark it as failed
    * call post-rollout webhooks
    * post the analysis result to Slack
    * wait for the canary deployment to be updated and start over
* increase canary traffic weight by 5% (step weight) till it reaches 50% (max weight) 
    * halt advancement if any webhook call fails
    * halt advancement while canary request success rate is under the threshold
    * halt advancement while canary request duration P99 is over the threshold
    * halt advancement if the primary or canary deployment becomes unhealthy 
    * halt advancement while canary deployment is being scaled up/down by HPA
* promote canary to primary
    * copy ConfigMaps and Secrets from canary to primary
    * copy canary deployment spec template over primary
* wait for primary rolling update to finish
    * halt advancement if pods are unhealthy
* route all traffic to primary
* scale to zero the canary deployment
* mark rollout as finished
* call post-rollout webhooks
* post the analysis result to Slack
* wait for the canary deployment to be updated and start over

### Canary Analysis

The canary analysis runs periodically until it reaches the maximum traffic weight or the failed checks threshold. 

Spec:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    # schedule interval (default 60s)
    interval: 1m
    # max number of failed metric checks before rollback
    threshold: 10
    # max traffic percentage routed to canary
    # percentage (0-100)
    maxWeight: 50
    # canary increment step
    # percentage (0-100)
    stepWeight: 2
  # deploy straight to production without
  # the metrics and webhook checks
  skipAnalysis: false
```

The above analysis, if it succeeds, will run for 25 minutes while validating the HTTP metrics and webhooks every minute.
You can determine the minimum time that it takes to validate and promote a canary deployment using this formula:

```
interval * (maxWeight / stepWeight)
```

And the time it takes for a canary to be rollback when the metrics or webhook checks are failing:

```
interval * threshold 
```

In emergency cases, you may want to skip the analysis phase and ship changes directly to production. 
At any time you can set the `spec.skipAnalysis: true`. 
When skip analysis is enabled, Flagger checks if the canary deployment is healthy and 
promotes it without analysing it. If an analysis is underway, Flagger cancels it and runs the promotion.

### A/B Testing

Besides weighted routing, Flagger can be configured to route traffic to the canary based on HTTP match conditions.
In an A/B testing scenario, you'll be using HTTP headers or cookies to target a certain segment of your users.
This is particularly useful for frontend applications that require session affinity.

You can enable A/B testing by specifying the HTTP match conditions and the number of iterations:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    # schedule interval (default 60s)
    interval: 1m
    # total number of iterations
    iterations: 10
    # max number of failed iterations before rollback
    threshold: 2
    # canary match condition
    match:
      - headers:
          user-agent:
            regex: "^(?!.*Chrome).*Safari.*"
      - headers:
          cookie:
            regex: "^(.*?;)?(user=test)(;.*)?$"
```

If Flagger finds a HTTP match condition, it will ignore the `maxWeight` and `stepWeight` settings.

The above configuration will run an analysis for ten minutes targeting the Safari users and those that have a test cookie.
You can determine the minimum time that it takes to validate and promote a canary deployment using this formula:

```
interval * iterations
```

And the time it takes for a canary to be rollback when the metrics or webhook checks are failing:

```
interval * threshold 
```

Make sure that the analysis threshold is lower than the number of iterations.

### HTTP Metrics

The canary analysis is using the following Prometheus queries:

**HTTP requests success rate percentage**

Spec:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    metrics:
    - name: request-success-rate
      # minimum req success rate (non 5xx responses)
      # percentage (0-100)
      threshold: 99
      interval: 1m
```

Istio query:

```javascript
sum(
    rate(
        istio_requests_total{
          reporter="destination",
          destination_workload_namespace=~"$namespace",
          destination_workload=~"$workload",
          response_code!~"5.*"
        }[$interval]
    )
) 
/ 
sum(
    rate(
        istio_requests_total{
          reporter="destination",
          destination_workload_namespace=~"$namespace",
          destination_workload=~"$workload"
        }[$interval]
    )
)
```

App Mesh query:

```javascript
sum(
    rate(
        envoy_cluster_upstream_rq{
          kubernetes_namespace="$namespace",
          kubernetes_pod_name=~"$workload",
          response_code!~"5.*"
        }[$interval]
    )
) 
/ 
sum(
    rate(
        envoy_cluster_upstream_rq{
          kubernetes_namespace="$namespace",
          kubernetes_pod_name=~"$workload"
        }[$interval]
    )
)
```

**HTTP requests milliseconds duration P99**

Spec:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    metrics:
    - name: request-duration
      # maximum req duration P99
      # milliseconds
      threshold: 500
      interval: 1m
```

Istio query:

```javascript
histogram_quantile(0.99, 
  sum(
    irate(
      istio_request_duration_seconds_bucket{
        reporter="destination",
        destination_workload=~"$workload",
        destination_workload_namespace=~"$namespace"
      }[$interval]
    )
  ) by (le)
)
```

App Mesh query:

```javascript
histogram_quantile(0.99, 
  sum(
    irate(
      envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_time_bucket{
        kubernetes_pod_name=~"$workload",
        kubernetes_namespace=~"$namespace"
      }[$interval]
    )
  ) by (le)
)
```

> **Note** that the metric interval should be lower or equal to the control loop interval.

### Custom Metrics

The canary analysis can be extended with custom Prometheus queries. 

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    threshold: 1
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 5
    metrics:
    - name: "404s percentage"
      threshold: 5
      query: |
        100 - sum(
            rate(
                istio_requests_total{
                  reporter="destination",
                  destination_workload_namespace="test",
                  destination_workload="podinfo",
                  response_code!="404"
                }[1m]
            )
        )
        /
        sum(
            rate(
                istio_requests_total{
                  reporter="destination",
                  destination_workload_namespace="test",
                  destination_workload="podinfo"
                }[1m]
            )
        ) * 100
```

The above configuration validates the canary by checking
if the HTTP 404 req/sec percentage is below 5 percent of the total traffic.
If the 404s rate reaches the 5% threshold, then the canary fails.

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    threshold: 1
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 5
    metrics:
    - name: "rpc error rate"
      threshold: 5
      query: |
        100 - (sum
            rate(
                grpc_server_handled_total{
                  grpc_service="my.TestService",
                  grpc_code!="OK"
                }[1m]
            )
        )
        /
        sum(
            rate(
                grpc_server_started_total{
                  grpc_service="my.TestService"
                }[1m]
            )
        ) * 100
```

The above configuration validates the canary by checking if the percentage of
non-OK GRPC req/sec is below 5 percent of the total requests. If the non-OK
rate reaches the 5% threshold, then the canary fails.

When specifying a query, Flagger will run the promql query and convert the result to float64. 
Then it compares the query result value with the metric threshold value.

### Webhooks

The canary analysis can be extended with webhooks. Flagger will call each webhook URL and
determine from the response status code (HTTP 2xx) if the canary is failing or not.

There are three types of hooks:
* Confirm-rollout hooks are executed before scaling up the canary deployment and ca be used for manual approval.
The rollout is paused until the hook returns a successful HTTP status code.
* Pre-rollout hooks are executed before routing traffic to canary. 
The canary advancement is paused if a pre-rollout hook fails and if the number of failures reach the 
threshold the canary will be rollback.
* Rollout hooks are executed during the analysis on each iteration before the metric checks. 
If a rollout hook call fails the canary advancement is paused and eventfully rolled back.
* Post-rollout hooks are executed after the canary has been promoted or rolled back. 
If a post rollout hook fails the error is logged.

Spec:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "start gate"
        type: confirm-rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/gate/approve
      - name: "smoke test"
        type: pre-rollout
        url: http://flagger-helmtester.kube-system/
        timeout: 3m
        metadata:
          type: "helm"
          cmd: "test podinfo --cleanup"
      - name: "load test"
        type: rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
        timeout: 15s
        metadata:
          cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 5 -c 2 http://podinfo-canary.test:9898/"
      - name: "notify"
        type: post-rollout
        url: http://telegram.bot:8080/
        timeout: 5s
        metadata:
          some: "message"
```

> **Note** that the sum of all rollout webhooks timeouts should be lower than the analysis interval. 

Webhook payload (HTTP POST):

```json
{
    "name": "podinfo",
    "namespace": "test",
    "phase": "Progressing", 
    "metadata": {
        "test":  "all",
        "token":  "16688eb5e9f289f1991c"
    }
}
```

Response status codes:

* 200-202 - advance canary by increasing the traffic weight
* timeout or non-2xx - halt advancement and increment failed checks

On a non-2xx response Flagger will include the response body (if any) in the failed checks log and Kubernetes events.

### Load Testing

For workloads that are not receiving constant traffic Flagger can be configured with a webhook, 
that when called, will start a load test for the target workload.
If the target workload doesn't receive any traffic during the canary analysis, 
Flagger metric checks will fail with "no values found for metric request-success-rate".

Flagger comes with a load testing service based on [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) 
that generates traffic during analysis when configured as a webhook.

![Flagger Load Testing Webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nholuongut/flagger/master/docs/diagrams/flagger-load-testing.png)

First you need to deploy the load test runner in a namespace with sidecar injection enabled:

```bash
export REPO=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nholuongut/flagger/master

kubectl -n test apply -f ${REPO}/artifacts/loadtester/deployment.yaml
kubectl -n test apply -f ${REPO}/artifacts/loadtester/service.yaml
```

Or by using Helm:

```bash
helm repo add flagger https://flagger.app

helm upgrade -i flagger-loadtester flagger/loadtester \
--namespace=test \
--set cmd.timeout=1h
```

When deployed the load tester API will be available at `http://flagger-loadtester.test/`. 

Now you can add webhooks to the canary analysis spec:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: load-test-get
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      type: cmd
      cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 http://podinfo-canary.test:9898/"
  - name: load-test-post
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      type: cmd
      cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 -m POST -d '{test: 2}' http://podinfo-canary.test:9898/echo"
```

When the canary analysis starts, Flagger will call the webhooks and the load tester will run the `hey` commands 
in the background, if they are not already running. This will ensure that during the 
analysis, the `podinfo-canary.test` service will receive a steady stream of GET and POST requests.

If your workload is exposed outside the mesh you can point `hey` to the 
public URL and use HTTP2.

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: load-test-get
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      type: cmd
      cmd: "hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 -h2 https://podinfo.example.com/"
```

For gRPC services you can use [bojand/ghz](https://github.com/bojand/ghz) which is a similar tool to Hey but for gPRC:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: grpc-load-test
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      type: cmd
      cmd: "ghz -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 --insecure podinfo.test:9898"
```

`ghz` uses reflection to identify which gRPC method to call. If you do not wish to enable reflection for your gRPC service you can implement a standardized health check from the [grpc-proto](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto) library. To use this [health check schema](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto/blob/master/grpc/health/v1/health.proto) without reflection you can pass a parameter to `ghz` like this

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: grpc-load-test-no-reflection
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      type: cmd
      cmd: "ghz --insecure --proto=/tmp/ghz/health.proto --call=grpc.health.v1.Health/Check podinfo.test:9898"
```

The load tester can run arbitrary commands as long as the binary is present in the container image.
For example if you you want to replace `hey` with another CLI, you can create your own Docker image:

```dockerfile
FROM nholuongut/flagger-loadtester:<VER>

RUN curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/my-cli https://github.com/user/repo/releases/download/ver/my-cli \
    && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/my-cli
```

### Load Testing Delegation

The load tester can also forward testing tasks to external tools, by now [nGrinder](https://github.com/naver/ngrinder)
is supported.

To use this feature, add a load test task of type 'ngrinder' to the canary analysis spec:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - name: load-test-post
    url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/
    timeout: 5s
    metadata:
      # type of this load test task, cmd or ngrinder
      type: ngrinder
      # base url of your nGrinder controller server
      server: http://ngrinder-server:port
      # id of the test to clone from, the test must have been defined.
      clone: 100
      # user name and base64 encoded password to authenticate against the nGrinder server
      username: admin
      passwd: YWRtaW4=
      # the interval between between nGrinder test status polling, default to 1s
      pollInterval: 5s
```
When the canary analysis starts, the load tester will initiate a [clone_and_start request](https://github.com/naver/ngrinder/wiki/REST-API-PerfTest)
to the nGrinder server and start a new performance test. the load tester will periodically poll the nGrinder server
for the status of the test, and prevent duplicate requests from being sent in subsequent analysis loops.

### Integration Testing

Flagger comes with a testing service that can run Helm tests or Bats tests when configured as a webhook.

Deploy the Helm test runner in the `kube-system` namespace using the `tiller` service account:

```bash
helm repo add flagger https://flagger.app

helm upgrade -i flagger-helmtester flagger/loadtester \
--namespace=kube-system \
--set serviceAccountName=tiller
```

When deployed the Helm tester API will be available at `http://flagger-helmtester.kube-system/`. 

Now you can add pre-rollout webhooks to the canary analysis spec:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "smoke test"
        type: pre-rollout
        url: http://flagger-helmtester.kube-system/
        timeout: 3m
        metadata:
          type: "helm"
          cmd: "test {{ .Release.Name }} --cleanup"
```

When the canary analysis starts, Flagger will call the pre-rollout webhooks before routing traffic to the canary.
If the helm test fails, Flagger will retry until the analysis threshold is reached and the canary is rolled back.

As an alternative to Helm you can use the [Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to run your tests. 

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "acceptance tests"
        type: pre-rollout
        url: http://flagger-batstester.default/
        timeout: 5m
        metadata:
          type: "bash"
          cmd: "bats /tests/acceptance.bats"
```

Note that you should create a ConfigMap with your Bats tests and mount it inside the tester container.

### Manual Gating

For manual approval of a canary deployment you can use the `confirm-rollout` webhook. 
The confirmation hooks are executed before the pre-rollout hooks. 
Flagger will halt the canary traffic shifting and analysis until the confirm webhook returns HTTP status 200.

Manual gating with Flagger's tester:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "gate"
        type: confirm-rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/gate/halt
```

The `/gate/halt` returns HTTP 403 thus blocking the rollout. 

If you have notifications enabled, Flagger will post a message to Slack or MS Teams if a canary rollout is waiting for approval.

Change the URL to `/gate/approve` to start the canary analysis:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "gate"
        type: confirm-rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/gate/approve
```

Manual gating can be driven with Flagger's tester API. Set the confirmation URL to `/gate/check`:

```yaml
  canaryAnalysis:
    webhooks:
      - name: "ask for confirmation"
        type: confirm-rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.test/gate/check
```

By default the gate is closed, you can start or resume the canary rollout with:

```bash
kubectl -n test exec -it flagger-loadtester-xxxx-xxxx sh

curl -d '{"name": "podinfo","namespace":"test"}' http://localhost:8080/gate/open 
```

You can pause the rollout at any time with:

```bash
curl -d '{"name": "podinfo","namespace":"test"}' http://localhost:8080/gate/close 
```

If a canary analysis is paused the status will change to waiting:

```bash
kubectl get canary/podinfo

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT
podinfo   Waiting       0
```
